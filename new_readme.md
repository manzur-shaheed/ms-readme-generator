## User Guide
This Web Application presents user with an input form where the user can select a museum to search from a list. Input for search text is in free-format. Both input text and search button ``` üîç ``` next to it is not available until the user selects a museum to search. Application shows an error message if user tries to search for an empty string.

Once user enters a search text and clicks ``` üîç ``` button, application makes API calls to either [Metropolitan Museum of Arts Collection](https://metmuseum.github.io/) or [Art Institute of Chicago](https://api.artic.edu/docs/) based on what museum was chosen for search. There are multiple API calls to get first metadata and then actual data.
Search text is saved and is displayed in ```History:``` list below the ```Search:``` input form. User can click on search text from the history list, application will first try to serve data from local cache, and call API if there is no data in cache. Search texts also shows the museum acronym next to them in small font, so user knows which museum was searched for this text. Search texts can also be deleted from the history list by clicking on the ```x``` button next to them. History list disappears once all the saved searches are deleted.

This application was built as responsive, so it adjusts layout based on device type. (desktop or mobile).
